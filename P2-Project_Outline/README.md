# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Our WebApp is going to be a virtual space for creative meditation and curation. Within the app, users will be able to gather and organize art from multiple mediums into singularly-themed, cohesive "playlists," which will be stored in a user's personal profile. Users will be able to create a profile that requires authentication to access, and the content added to playlists by users would be added to the website library for other users to access and create. There will be a limitation on how many items can be placed within the playlist (somewhere between three to nine pieces), and the profiles will be public by default with the option to be made private.

### Features
- **Profiles**: users will be able to create and log in to a profile to access their specific content.
- **Playlist Creation**: once the user is authenticated, they will be able to create a few playlists of multimedia content. The playlists will be limited in scope to a range of three to nine items.
- **View Public Playlists**: users will be able to discover the playlists of other users with publically accessible profiles.
- **Fork Playlists**: once a foreign playlist is discovered, the user will be able to adopt and change the foreign playlist as they see fit.
- **Tag Playlists**: users will be able to categorize their own playlists by various metrics. The metrics can be somewhat concrete like "pop music," or more esoteric like "blue," or "Mom."
- **Search**: users will be able to search through their own curated playlists, as well as discover other public playlists with a specific keyword or tag. 

### Technologies
- ASP.NET Web API backend
- Angular frontend
    TypeScript
    HTML
    CSS Bootstrap/SASS

### What I'll Have to Learn
- a deeper understanding of Angular for its use in our Front End
- Creating and implementing the ASP.NETCore Web API
- Some kind of database integration to store the art library
- ...and things that I couldn't predict right now, but nonetheless am excited for!
